My personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Theme
I couldn't find a theme that I liked, so I built one exactly how I wanted it. You're welcome to use it if you like. It's called [Spartan](https://github.com/itsmattburgess/hugo-theme-spartan).

## Hosting
If I was doing anything more clever than a static site, i'd be using some Serverless services on AWS. Github Pages however is great for Hugo sites, its basically plug and play. Tip of the day: Don't make your life harder than it needs to be, you can always change tech later.
