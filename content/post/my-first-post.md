I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite) There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) Java is, in many ways, C++–. (Michael Feldman)

It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. (Marvin Minsky) But what is it good for? (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. (Blair Houghton) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel)

Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.

(Linus Torvalds) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz)
